Reduced Modeling of Arteries (RedMA)
=========

We implement Reduced Order Models for cardiovascular modeling based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Results obtained with this library have been published in the paper:

Luca Pegolotti, Martin Pfaller, Alison L. Marsden, and Simone Deparis. Model order reduction of flow based on a modular geometrical approximation of blood vessels.Â Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 380 (2021): 113762.
