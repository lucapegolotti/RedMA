/*! \brief Finite element assembler of the Navier-Stokes problem with the Coupled Momentum method.
 *
 * The equations are defined, for every \f$(x,t)\in \Omega\f$, as
 *
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *        \rho \dot{u} + \rho (u \cdot \nabla)u - \nabla \cdot \sigma(u,p) &= f, \\
 *        \nabla \cdot u &= 0,
 * \f}
 * where \f$u\f$ and \f$p\f$ are velocity and pressure of the fluid,
 * \f[
 *       \sigma(u,p) = 2\mu \varepsilon(u) - pI, \quad \varepsilon(u) = (\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T)/2,
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$\rho\f$ is the density of the fluid, and \f$\mu\f$ its viscosity.
 *
 * Under the assumption of small displacements, the Coupled Momentum method allows to embed the
 * dynamics of the vessel motion in the equations for the blood flow. In particular, it allows
 * to obtain a reduced FSI formulation, where a Navier-Stokes system in a fixed fluid domain
 * is supplemented by a Robin boundary condition that acts as a surrogate of the structure model.
 * We refer to the following work for further information:
 *
 * Colciago, C.M., Deparis, S. and Quarteroni, A., 2014.
 * Comparisons between reduced order models and full 3D models for fluidâ€“structure interaction
 * problems in haemodynamics.
 * Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 265, pp.120-138.
 *
 * In particular, the wall displacement is not directly inserted in the system to be solved;
 * rather, a time-marching scheme analogous to the one employed for velocity and pressure
 * is used to perform extrapolation (before the system resolution) and update (after the
 * system resolution).
 *
 * In some methods, it is required to associate variables and matrices to specific
 * indices.
 *
 * Indices of the components: velocity = 0, pressure = 1.
 * Indices of the matrices: mass = 0, stiffness = 1, divergence = 2.
 * Indices of boundary matrices: mass = 0, stiffness = 1, wall mass = 1
