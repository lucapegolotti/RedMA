/*! \brief Class that allows to compute the membrane thickness of the vessel wall in a building block.
 *
 * In the Coupled Momentum method, the structure of the vessel wall is approximated with a thin membrane
 * of a certain thickness. We refer to the following work for further information:
 *
 * Colciago, C.M., Deparis, S. and Quarteroni, A., 2014.
 * Comparisons between reduced order models and full 3D models for fluidâ€“structure interaction
 * problems in haemodynamics.
 * Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 265, pp.120-138.
 *
 * This class allows to compute the membrane thickness over all the vessel wall. This computation can be
 * done in two ways, depending on the value of a suitable flag, called "constant_thickness", set in the datafile.
 * If the flag is true, the thickness equals a fixed percentage (set in the datafile) of the average between
 * the inlet diameter and the average outlet diameters. I the flag is false, the membrane thickness is
 * computed by solving a homogeneous Laplacian problem, where Dirichlet BCs, prescribing a thickness equal
 * to a fixed percentage (set in the datafile) of the vessel diameter, are imposed at the I/O rings.
 *
